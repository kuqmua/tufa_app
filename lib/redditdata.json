But India has more than just tea on offer. Rue stumbles upon a plot involving local dissidents, a kidnapped brigadier's wife, and some awfully familiar Scottish werewolves. Faced with a dire crisis and an embarrassing lack of bloomers, what else is a young lady of good breeding to do but turn metanatural and find out everyone's secrets, even thousand-year-old fuzzy ones? \n\nFor May we will be reading Prudence by Gail Carriger. Gail will be joining us on **Thursday, May 28** for an AMA.\n\nAs always, the dates of and links to the discussion threads can be found in the sticky comment on this post. You are welcome to read at your own pace. Don't worry about joining later on in the month. Usually it is pretty easy to catch up, but you are always welcome to join the discussions a little later.\n\nFor those of you that are viewing reddit on the redesigned desktop version you will see an option on this post to 'follow'. If you 'follow' the book club post you will receive a notification when a new post, a discussion thread for book club, is added to the collection.

Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.\n\n * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.\n\n ____\n\n **How to get the best recommendations**\n\n The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.\n\n ____\n\n All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.\n\n If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.\n\n- The Management",

His bizarre misadventures, where he sweeps everyone he meets into a storm of legal trouble, headache-inducing rants, and hygiene problems, are enthralling. I could barley put the book down.\n\nThe story is a great example of how to write a disgusting protagonist. I think it works because of how much effort is put on the larger world. Virtually every character in the story is an awful person, with the most relatable characters being people who have been dumped on by society. Even then, the prime focus of the story is blasting every aspect of the human race. It's scathing, it's crude (in the most articulate way possible), and it has a strange heart to it.\n\nFor most of the story, I felt almost bad for enjoying it. It had that \"dirty\" quality because it delves headlong into the gutter, but writes with a style that made me actively need to think in order to get down to that level. Then, suddenly, the story hit me with a heart. For a brief moment, even, I saw Ignatius as a human being. A disgusting, miserable excuse for a human being, but a human being nonetheless.\n\nThe line \"You learned everything except how to be a human being\" will stick with me for a long time.",

I could barley put the book down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story is a great example of how to write a disgusting protagonist. I think it works because of how much effort is put on the larger world. Virtually every character in the story is an awful person, with the most relatable characters being people who have been dumped on by society. Even then, the prime focus of the story is blasting every aspect of the human race. It&amp;#39;s scathing, it&amp;#39;s crude (in the most articulate way possible), and it has a strange heart to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For most of the story, I felt almost bad for enjoying it. It had that &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot; quality because it delves headlong into the gutter, but writes with a style that made me actively need to think in order to get down to that level. Then, suddenly, the story hit me with a heart. For a brief moment, even, I saw Ignatius as a human being. A disgusting, miserable excuse for a human being, but a human being nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The line &amp;quot;You learned everything except how to be a human being&amp;quot; will stick with me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "I\u2019ve always enjoyed King, but have been a bit out of reading for a while now. Assigned reading for school sort of burned me out. And then I picked up The Outsider as a beach read early this year, and reignited my love of reading and King in particular. I\u2019d had Night Shift on my shelf for a while and hadn\u2019t touched it, so after finishing The Institute I cracked into it. I have had so much fun reading the stories, even if some of them are a bit kooky. I really do think short stories are his strong suit. I have thoughts about most, if not all of the stories, so I\u2019d love to discuss with anyone else who\u2019s read it!\n\nBest stories:\n\n-*Jerusalem's Lot*: I love this one. What a great kickoff to the book. I found the style of it so interesting, the choice to write in journal entry and letter form rather than just traditional story format. I have Salem's Lot to read next, so I\u2019m excited to continue the story of Jerusalem's Lot. \n\n-*Night Surf*: I know this was a precursor to The Stand, and I know The Stand is a hot topic with the pandemic going on right now. This one was just as interesting because of current events. I didn\u2019t like the protagonist much, I thought he was unpleasant, and I don\u2019t know if it would have stood out to me as much without everything going on right now, but some of it felt eerily familiar and so I really liked it. \n\n-*The Boogeyman*: again, one with an unlikeable protagonist, and I thought it was really compelling in this story. Billings is a terrible father, but I liked how it subverted the idea of the parent who\u2019d do anything to save their child... instead, Billings, being as selfish as he is, puts himself above the child he claims to have loved unlike his first two. The ending was one of the better ones, I knew the closet being ajar in the therapist's office would be relevant but didn\u2019t expect it to happen as it did. \n\n-*Battleground*: this one was so fun. The idea of the toys come to life and waging all out war against Renshaw, I loved it. I think this story painted some of the most vivid imagery in my mind. And that ending... where you think he\u2019s about to get the better of them, and then he fails in the homestretch. \n\n-*Trucks*: again, one of those situational things. I read this one while on the interstate, in a truck, after leaving a truck stop, so it was easy to imagine the setting. One of the most bleak stories in the book, but for some reason the idea of vehicles gaining self-awareness had me side-eyeing the semis at every rest stop after finishing this. \n\n-*Sometimes They Come Back*: I thought this was one of the most compelling stories in the book. The ending fell a bit flat for me, with the demon exorcism thing in the classroom. But I enjoyed up until that. Realizing what was going on with the boys coming back to haunt Jim. Again, one of those stories that seems made for a movie, and I know there was one\u2014 but I think I\u2019ll hold off on it, since it seems to have less than stellar reviews. \n\n-*The Ledge*: left me so uncomfortable, not quite knowing if Norris would make it. I was genuine squirming so much with how much description King put into the imagery going on.. I could imagine it, and I didn\u2019t like it. Still, Cressner was such an interesting antagonist that I had to know how it ended. \n\n-*Quitter's Inc.*: this one was possibly one of the top stories in the book, in my opinion. I enjoyed following as Morrison became more and more indoctrinated. The ending, where he sends someone else to them in the same way his old friend sent him, was very satisfying, seeing the vicious cycle continue. \n\n-*I Know What You Need*: my other top story. Ed was such an interesting antagonist; he\u2019s not outright bad, but there\u2019s just something off about him, just enough to make you distrust him and root for the roommate who tries to convince Liz that he\u2019s not right. I love a sympathetic villain, so I really liked how he had some qualities that made you feel a bit sorry for him, with his poor upbringing and social isolation. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read it, what are your thoughts?",

The ending was one of the better ones, I knew the closet being ajar in the therapist&amp;#39;s office would be relevant but didn\u2019t expect it to happen as it did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Battleground&lt;/em&gt;: this one was so fun. The idea of the toys come to life and waging all out war against Renshaw, I loved it. I think this story painted some of the most vivid imagery in my mind. And that ending... where you think he\u2019s about to get the better of them, and then he fails in the homestretch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Trucks&lt;/em&gt;: again, one of those situational things. I read this one while on the interstate, in a truck, after leaving a truck stop, so it was easy to imagine the setting. One of the most bleak stories in the book, but for some reason the idea of vehicles gaining self-awareness had me side-eyeing the semis at every rest stop after finishing this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Sometimes They Come Back&lt;/em&gt;: I thought this was one of the most compelling stories in the book. The ending fell a bit flat for me, with the demon exorcism thing in the classroom. But I enjoyed up until that. Realizing what was going on with the boys coming back to haunt Jim. Again, one of those stories that seems made for a movie, and I know there was one\u2014 but I think I\u2019ll hold off on it, since it seems to have less than stellar reviews. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;The Ledge&lt;/em&gt;: left me so uncomfortable, not quite knowing if Norris would make it. I was genuine squirming so much with how much description King put into the imagery going on.. I could imagine it, and I didn\u2019t like it. Still, Cressner was such an interesting antagonist that I had to know how it ended. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Quitter&amp;#39;s Inc.&lt;/em&gt;: this one was possibly one of the top stories in the book, in my opinion. I enjoyed following as Morrison became more and more indoctrinated. The ending, where he sends someone else to them in the same way his old friend sent him, was very satisfying, seeing the vicious cycle continue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;I Know What You Need&lt;/em&gt;: my other top story. Ed was such an interesting antagonist; he\u2019s not outright bad, but there\u2019s just something off about him, just enough to make you distrust him and root for the roommate who tries to convince Liz that he\u2019s not right. I love a sympathetic villain, so I really liked how he had some qualities that made you feel a bit sorry for him, with his poor upbringing and social isolation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve read it, what are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I'm not asking for recommendations because different strokes etc &amp; I don't want to try name any of the books I've not liked because someone else might like them and I don't want to shame, but of the 22 book's I read this year so far, i've enjoyed maybe 4-5 of them. \n\nI really have no idea what's going on. Have I changed? Am I a harsher critic then before? Have I just been unlucky? I've really just failed to get engaged with most of what i've been reading - flat, nonsensical plots, under-developed cookie-cutter characters. I'm not getting *immersed* anymore. I really long for the feeling of just sinking in and losing all of my own problems, forgetting real-world time, and becoming so engaged with a book that it feels like, while I'm reading it, that it's reality. \n\nUsually when I finish a book I'm brimming with excitement to pick-up the next one and dig in. I read before bed, and when I finish a book I usually have to stay up late to start the next one because i'm so excited to start, but recently i've been browsing my 'unread' shelf and felt no excitement. 'It's probably crap,' my mind says 'it'll probably have flat characters and a boring plot like the others.' It doesn't help that the last 3-4 titles i've read i've really gone out of my way to treat myself (and spend money i should not have) on something I was sure looked great, and I've been dissapointed by most of them.\n\nI'm a faster reader than anyone else i know. Reading about an hour before bed each night, I'll finish a 3-400 page standard novel in about a week, so even when I do stumble upon something I like i *still* end up feeling bad about it, since I know it's not going to last long before I'm back in an endless slog of not enjoying what I'm reading. Even if I put books down before finishing them when i'm not enjoying myself, I feel terrible reading the first few chapters of 5 books in a row and then putting them down on a growing pile of 'Books I started but didn't want to finish.'\n\nI've started watching Netflix before bed instead, doing an hour-long episode of something each night. It's okay. It still helps me relax by putting my stress and the world out of my mind, but the light makes it harder to go to sleep. I miss reading, I just feel really burnt out and I'm sick of muddling through mediocre titles. The frustrating thing is I *do* enjoy something every now and then, it just feels like such a slog to go through the work of *finding* a book I like by sorting through everything else. I can't rely on Reviews or Rating since, in my experience, a book's rating on Goodreads is completely uncorrelated (not even anti-correlated) with how I feel about it. \n\nI want to read, im just sick of sorting chaff. What do you do when you feel like this? What do you do when you start a book you don't like? What do you think your 'hit rate' between buying(or borrowing)/choosing a book to read and actually liking it is? I used to be pretty good and would enjoy the majority of books I read, but the last 8 or 9 months or so have just been a reading slog. Again, I'm not asking for recommendations, but some advice or experience would be nice.",

          "selftext": "Using pageview statistics from the most developed language versions  of Wikipedia we created ranking of the most popular books in April 2020.  The international top 10 books includes: Bible, 1984, My Next Life as a  Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, Dune, Sword Art Online, Re:Zero  kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu, KonoSuba, Don Quixote, The Plague and The  Lord of the Rings.\n\n## Briefly about the methodology\n\nWikipedia currently has over 53 million articles in over 300  languages. Despite the impressive number of articles, not all topics can  be written in this free encyclopedia. At the same time, the community  of each language version has the ability to decide which topic can be  described in the encyclopedia, and which is not (for example, article  must be [notable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability)).  In addition, each language version can describe the same topic in its  own way - it all depends on the quantity and quality of the authors  (Wikipedia users who edit articles).\n\nAlmost every Wikipedia article has an aligment to certain categories.  Additionally, based on the content, you can specify the subject of the  article - for this you can, for example, use semantic relations in [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) or [DBpedia](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/). More details on the automatic article classification process can be found in various scientific works (e.g. for [articles](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/8/3/60) or [sources](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/5/263)).\n\nThis article selected the most-developed language versions of  Wikipedia with over 1 million articles, including English, German,  French, Spanish, Russian, Polish and other. After the classification of  articles, only those that are dedicated to individual books. As a result  for English Wikipedia 56591 articles about books were found, French -  24199 books, Italian - 15796 books, German - 13190 books, Spanish -  11783 books, Russian - 8126 books, Portuguese - 7189 books, Polish -  6925 books, Arabic - 6617 books, Japanese - 6099 books and Chinese -  5095 books.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, every Wikipedia article can have different  language versions, so we can find out different names of the same object  (book). Using [open data on Wikipedia article views](https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/)  we can find out how many times a given article has been viewed on  specific days. After collecting data for viewing all Wikipedia articles  on books in the appropriate language versions April 2020 ranking of the  most readable was made. First, the positions of books in the ranking are  shown, which were obtained by adding up the page views from different  language versions for a given book. Later, the most popular books are  shown for only one language version of Wikipedia.\n\nRecently we [observed](https://blog.wikirank.net/2020/wikirank-upgrade-fair-popularity-and-new-features/)  that visitors number for some articles was \u201coverclocked\u201d in some  periods of time. Therefore, we decide to provide additional modification  of the pageview statistics for such cases and change this number  (usually by reduction). Fairness of statistics for each article in  selected language version in selected months can be assessed using such  indicators as: number of the edits and authors, page protection, the  rate of citation increasing of the article, popularity statistics of  related keywords (phrases) in Google Trends and others.\n\n## 1st place - Bible\n\n[**Bible**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible)  \\- collection of sacred books in Judaism and Christianity, in April 2020  the book was on the 1st place in English, on the 2nd place in Spanish,  on the 3rd place in Portuguese, on the 6th place in Polish, on the 9th  place in Italian, on the 10th place in Arabic,  German, on the 16th  place in Russian, on the 18th place in French, on the 76th place in  Chinese and on the 179th place in Japanese Wikipedia.\n\n## 2nd place - 1984\n\n[**1984**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen%20Eighty-Four)  \\- dystopian novel written by George Orwell, in April 2020 the book was  on the 2nd place in French, on the 3rd place in English,  Spanish, on  the 4th place in German,  Portuguese,  Russian, on the 5th place in  Italian, on the 11th place in Polish, on the 27th place in Arabic, on  the 30th place in Japanese and on the 31st place in Chinese Wikipedia.\n\n## 3rd place - My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!\n\n[**My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My%20Next%20Life%20as%20a%20Villainess%3A%20All%20Routes%20Lead%20to%20Doom%21)  \\- Japanese light novel series, in April 2020 the book was on the 1st  place in Japanese,  Chinese, on the 22nd place in English, on the 66th  place in Spanish, on the 567th place in French, on the 705th place in  Polish and on the 821st place in German Wikipedia.\n\n## 4th place - Dune\n\n[**Dune**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune%20%28novel%29)  \\- 1965 science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, in April 2020 the book  was on the 2nd place in English, on the 6th place in Portuguese, on the  9th place in Russian, on the 17th place in Spanish,  Polish, on the 24th  place in French, on the 74th place in Italian, on the 272nd place in  Japanese and on the 431st place in Arabic Wikipedia.\n\n## 5th place - Sword Art Online\n\n[**Sword Art Online**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword%20Art%20Online)  \\- Japanese light novel series, in April 2020 the book was on the 4th  place in Chinese, on the 5th place in Japanese, on the 12th place in  French,  Portuguese, on the 20th place in English, on the 23rd place in  Spanish, on the 47th place in Italian, on the 52nd place in German, on  the 67th place in Russian, on the 93rd place in Polish and on the 125th  place in Arabic Wikipedia.\n\n## 6th place - Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu\n\n[**Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re%3AZero%20%E2%88%92%20Starting%20Life%20in%20Another%20World)  \\- Japanese light novel series, in April 2020 the book was on the 3rd  place in Japanese, on the 5th place in Chinese, on the 19th place in  English, on the 21st place in Portuguese, on the 42nd place in Spanish,  on the 61st place in French, on the 99th place in Russian, on the 121st  place in Italian, on the 155th place in Arabic, on the 174th place in  German and on the 258th place in Polish Wikipedia.\n\n## 7th place - KonoSuba\n\n[**KonoSuba**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KonoSuba)  \\- Japanese light novel series, in April 2020 the book was on the 6th  place in Japanese,  Chinese, on the 13th place in English, on the 21st  place in Spanish, on the 32nd place in Portuguese, on the 36th place in  Russian, on the 93rd place in French, on the 184th place in German and  on the 205th place in Italian Wikipedia.\n\n## 8th place - Don Quixote\n\n[**Don Quixote**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%20Quixote)  \\- novel by the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, in April  2020 the book was on the 1st place in Spanish, on the 5th place in  Portuguese, on the 10th place in French, on the 13th place in German, on  the 18th place in English, on the 19th place in Italian, on the 34th  place in Arabic, on the 41st place in Chinese, on the 50th place in  Polish, on the 65th place in Russian and on the 108th place in Japanese  Wikipedia.\n\n## 9th place - The Plague\n\n[**The Plague**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Plague)  \\- French novel by Albert Camus, in April 2020 the book was on the 1st  place in German,  French, on the 9th place in Japanese, on the 10th  place in Polish, on the 14th place in Italian, on the 19th place in  Spanish, on the 29th place in English, on the 77th place in Russian, on  the 89th place in Arabic, on the 97th place in Portuguese and on the  332nd place in Chinese Wikipedia.\n\n## 10th place - The Lord of the Rings\n\n[**The Lord of the Rings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings)  \\- 1954\u20131955 fantasy novel by J.

The international top 10 books includes: Bible, 1984, My Next Life as a  Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, Dune, Sword Art Online, Re:Zero  kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu, KonoSuba, Don Quixote, The Plague and The  Lord of the Rings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Briefly about the methodology&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia currently has over 53 million articles in over 300  languages. Despite the impressive number of articles, not all topics can  be written in this free encyclopedia. At the same time, the community  of each language version has the ability to decide which topic can be  described in the encyclopedia, and which is not (for example, article  must be &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability\"&gt;notable&lt;/a&gt;).  In addition, each language version can describe the same topic in its  own way - it all depends on the quantity and quality of the authors  (Wikipedia users who edit articles).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Almost every Wikipedia article has an aligment to certain categories.  Additionally, based on the content, you can specify the subject of the  article - for this you can, for example, use semantic relations in &lt;a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\"&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://wiki.dbpedia.org/\"&gt;DBpedia&lt;/a&gt;. More details on the automatic article classification process can be found in various scientific works (e.g. for &lt;a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/8/3/60\"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/5/263\"&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This article selected the most-developed language versions of  Wikipedia with over 1 million articles, including English, German,  French, Spanish, Russian, Polish and other. After the classification of  articles, only those that are dedicated to individual books. As a result  for English Wikipedia 56591 articles about books were found, French -  24199 books, Italian - 15796 books, German - 13190 books, Spanish -  11783 books, Russian - 8126 books, Portuguese - 7189 books, Polish -  6925 books, Arabic - 6617 books, Japanese - 6099 books and Chinese -  5095 books.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, every Wikipedia article can have different  language versions, so we can find out different names of the same object  (book). Using &lt;a href=\"https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/\"&gt;open data on Wikipedia article views&lt;/a&gt;  we can find out how many times a given article has been viewed on  specific days. After collecting data for viewing all Wikipedia articles  on books in the appropriate language versions April 2020 ranking of the  most readable was made. First, the positions of books in the ranking are  shown, which were obtained by adding up the page views from different  language versions for a given book. Later, the most popular books are  shown for only one language version of Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently we &lt;a href=\"https://blog.wikirank.net/2020/wikirank-upgrade-fair-popularity-and-new-features/\"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt;  that visitors number for some articles was \u201coverclocked\u201d in some  periods of time. Therefore, we decide to provide additional modification  of the pageview statistics for such cases and change this number  (usually by reduction). Fairness of statistics for each article in  selected language version in selected months can be assessed using such  indicators as: number of the edits and authors, page protection, the  rate of citation increasing of the article, popularity statistics of  related keywords (phrases) in Google Trends and others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;1st place - Bible&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Looking online it seems most places are selling the books with these new, minimalist black covers with pictures of hands holding things. There is nothing wrong with them, but I really want to have the original art work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand it may not be possible but if anybody knows where I could order them or at least a set with more interesting covers, I&amp;#39;d really appriciate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Fiction, non-fiction, poetry, prose, Adams's carefully curated epigraphs illuminate, educate, and elevate an already great tale.  Cited poets and novelists include **Aeschylus, Browning, Renault, Malory, Tennyson, Yeats, Thomas, Hardy, Austen, Carroll, Dostoevsky, de la Mare, and Shakespeare**. **Clausewitz, Napoleon** and **Wellington** front chapters, as do **Gilgamesh, Joseph Campbell**, and the librettist of Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte, **Lorenzo da Ponte.  R.M. Lockley,** author of The Private Life of The Rabbit, informatively leads multiple chapters.  \n\nMy favorite (it is hard to choose) is the excerpt from **Robinson Jeffers's** poem *Hurt Hawks*, which begins chapter 23, Kehaar:\n\n&gt;The wing trails like a banner in defeat,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No more to use the sky for ever but live with famine and pain a few days.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He is strong and pain is worse to the strong  \n&gt;  \n&gt;incapacity is worse  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No one but death the redeemer will humble that head,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes.\n\nI won't include spoilers in this post, but the poem is an impeccably fitting introduction to the chapter and character - one almost wonders if Adams started with a scrapbook full of quotations around which to frame his story.  \n\nThe cumulative effect of these tasty quotes and excerpts is to enhance an already masterful act of storytelling.  If an epigraph can be seen as a form of miniature storytelling in itself, foreshadowing what is to come, they add yet another wonderful layer to Watership, combining with the embedded stories of El-ahrairah and the story proper.  Watership is brilliant on so many levels, but Adams's masterful use of epigraphs adds even more enjoyment for the reader - and even leading them on to new writers and works to explore.",
